What is a Component in React?
In React, a component is a reusable, self-contained piece of code that defines part of the UI (User Interface). Components allow you to break the UI into independent, reusable pieces, making it easier to build complex applications.

React components can be of two types:
Functional Components (preferred in modern React)
Class Components (older React, still used in some cases)

Why Components?

Reusability: Components can be reused across different parts of your app, reducing redundancy.
Separation of Concerns: Each component is responsible for a specific part of the UI, which makes the app easier to manage and maintain.
Modular: Building an app using components allows you to easily break down complex interfaces into smaller, manageable pieces.

JSX Elements: react comp returns jsx
     		JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension used in React to write UI elements in a more intuitive and readable way. JSX allows you to combine JavaScript and HTML-like syntax to create React elements.
